                  Creativity and aesthetics is one of the areas of expertise I am
                  interested in improving, as I often find myself neglecting
                  aesthetics while working on function, that is why I wanted to
                  learn and improve this year. One of the ways in which I improved
                  were certain assignments, assignments that did not have that big
                  of an aesthetics side on their own, and introduced some art into
                  them to experiment, for example for creative electronics we had to
                  write a series of reports, for which I made cover pages. Doing
                  this gave me the opportunity to work more with colour, but it also
                  gave me the opportunity to test out fun stuff in Blender, I
                  experimented with material light and geometry nodes (coding).
                  Doing this gave me the opportunity to train my eye for design
                  more, learn what works and what does not, which I will be able to
                  use later on to make things look better, it also gave me some
                  technical skills, which ties into technology and realization.
                  There was one thing that worked less well, as I was working to
                  much on experimenting under the excuse of working for the course,
                  so for next time I will change one thing, I will introduce a
                  maximum time to work on something like this, something like two
                  hours, doing so will allow me to improve, without being a
                  detriment to the other courses.

                    Math, Data and Computing is one area of expertise I did not have
                    much experience in so this year I laid the foundation. One of the
                    courses that helped me with doing so was Data analytics for
                    engineers, in this course I was taught the basics of handling
                    data, I got the chance to create data frames, crunch data, and
                    create graphs. This course went well for the biggest part as it
                    uses methods from Technology and realisation to crunch numbers,
                    something that was easy for me to wrap my head around, there was
                    another part that went less well however, and that was the theory,
                    specifically the terms, I had difficulty remembering them, this
                    ties to how I generally remember things, I remember things by what
                    they do, as a visual process, I know what type of plot is
                    necessary for the job, but I do not know the name of said plot.
                    This made the final test difficult, as I had to rely on my cheat
                    sheet (allowed) to remember all terms. I think that this ties to
                    my liking of the iterative design process, and my reliance on it,
                    I am able to experiment with how things work, but not with what
                    something is called. Next time I will try some other memorization
                    methods, as these terms are necessary to communicate effectively,
                    this may help me remember terms, but on the other side it will
                    also take me a lot of time.

                    Technology and realisation is the expertise area which I like to
                    work in the most, from coding, modelling and electronics I like to
                    do them, that is why I want to improve in this area a lot more.
                    One of the biggest contributions to this area of expertise this
                    year were the challenges I have gotten in coding. I have worked on
                    java for creative programming, a language I have used for a
                    plethora of courses since then, mostly in prototypes, I have also
                    learned how to handle a bit of python, which I now use to create
                    graphs and visualizations for Math, Data, and computing. Lastly I
                    have also learned HTML and CSS so I could make this portfolio. The
                    way I have been learning these languages ties into my professional
                    identity, firstly I like to learn, which has made it easier for me
                    to spend a lot of extra time on this, secondly the way of
                    learning, I have been using the iterative design process, in a
                    way, I have been using a lot of trial-and-error to figure out a
                    big part of coding. Another reason coding has been easier for me
                    has been because I have been setting challenges for myself,
                    choosing to code this portfolio for example, was a choice I made
                    to learn more. All the coding so far has been a huge help, as I
                    have been able to apply them to various prototypes, I have also
                    been able to apply the methods to Blender, so it also applies to
                    Creativity and Aesthetics. One thing that is less good is that I
                    am spending a lot of time on this area, which on its own is not
                    bad, but at times it means I spend less time working on other
                    areas, I do like to specialize, but I also have to work on other
                    areas, so next time I will set time slots in which I am only
                    allowed to work on other areas of expertise.

                  This year I got the information skills course, for this course we learned
                  how to better use the web and databases to search for papers and research
                  to apply to projects. We learned how to set up better queries, and
                  learning how to test for relevancy. The stuff I learned in this course
                  will be relevant for many courses to come, as I am now better able to look
                  for supporting research and set up better research papers of my own. One
                  thing that went less well for me was how I had to reference, which is why
                  I researched it for a bit and now I am able to do it.

                  The biggest development for this area this year was for a USE
                  course, the sustainability challenge, for this course we had to
                  place ourselves into the position of all stakeholders involved
                  with a certain case to look at what they would think about certain
                  decisions, and involve their views into the design process, we
                  also learned to work with some ethical models. The course has
                  helped me look at things from more perspectives, while not
                  throwing away the science behind choices. One thing that went less
                  well was the theory, we had to apply the theory to our case, which
                  could have gone better, I think it was mostly because of the lack
                  of background knowledge, so for next time I will read more into
                  the subject, to familiarize myself more with the dynamics between
                  the stakeholders, as that would have made the course easier.

                  Business and entrepreneurship is an area of expertise for which I
                  have gotten only a few opportunities to grow, one of which was the
                  co-creation workshop we did for project 1. In this workshop we had
                  to involve other stakeholders into our process. We involved a
                  therapist, someone who could tell us more about our target group
                  and also possibilities of where our product could be used. Looking
                  back this cocreation session was extremely helpful, it paved the
                  way to what we ended up doing, helping with everything from
                  direction to the aesthetics of our product. One thing that could
                  have gone better was perhaps the moment we involved them, as we
                  were already pretty far along and had to take a step backwards,
                  losing some process, so for next time we will involve people
                  sooner.

                  This year I have spent a considerable amount of time to improve my
                  communication skill, the place where I mostly went to improve it was a
                  culture association I am a part of. A goal I had set was to go at least
                  once a week, something I wanted to do as my communication skill was just
                  not cutting it, in this association I have had various conversations with
                  people, conversations that gave me more perspectives, something I like and
                  is part of my professional identity. This method has given me a way to
                  improve my communication all the while I gained more perspectives on how
                  to do tasks, as everyone comes from different studies, for example one
                  person gave me what was basically a lecture on types of 3D printer
                  filaments and another gave me history lectures, all this information will
                  let me solve more types of problems.

                  For this year I had several goals and I made a lot of progress towards
                  them. My first goal was to improve my communication skills, my plan was to
                  do this by going outside of my comfort zone, to join an association and
                  join activities regularly, and I followed this through, I joined Kinjin,
                  where I joined an activity once a week and this helped me in improving
                  communication, it gave me the chance to talk to new people on a weekly
                  basis and gave me the opportunity to show who I was. From this goal I have
                  gained some more confidence, but it is still not enough, so I will be
                  continuing doing this. Another of my goals was to improve in Blender, I
                  had planned to do this by 1, using Blender 3 times a week (30 min
                  sessions) and joining competitions, I somewhat managed to do this first
                  goal, doing way more at times, but none at others, but this second part I
                  did not do at all, this was mostly because of procrastination, instead of
                  setting a timeframe in which I will achieve this goal I will drop it and
                  replace it with something different, I will set up a place on some social
                  media to post progress updates or art, to show the world what I can do.
                  The goals I set did help and I found it very nice to have a set amount of
                  time after dinner which I can only use to do Blender and a few other tasks
                  that I liked, doing this gave me more motivation, thus I will keep it in
                  my routine.

                  This year I have gone to a couple of external activities to develop in
                  several expertise areas, one example a workshop for Figma, in this
                  workshop we were taught some of the basics for web development and they
                  taught us the right way to think for making a website. I have been able to
                  apply the knowledge learned from this workshop on this portfolio for
                  example, as the way of thinking made it easier to learn CSS. I liked this
                  workshop, which was to be expected, as I like to learn especially when it
                  is about ways to think (new perspectives). I also went to a photoshop
                  workshop, as I wanted to learn more creativity and aesthetics all the
                  while learning how to use a very useful tool, however this workshop was a
                  total bust, it only went into the very basics of the program, learning how
                  to rotate something, or how to revert an action, so I did not learn
                  anything, as these actions are the same for most programs. This workshop
                  also annoyed me, as someone who likes to learn, as instead of learning
                  processes which you could you how to create stuff, we learned how to
                  create one specific thing using methods that everyone should have known,
                  like copy pasting from the internet.

              As a designer I strive to see different perspectives, this is
              because these perspectives offer me new ways to think, new ways to
              do, they allow me to solve more problems, or solve problems in
              different ways, be it faster, prettier, or easier. They also allow
              me to understand others better, letting me design for others
              better, or to explain my thoughts better. Something I love about
              design is the iterative design process, as I love to learn from my
              mistakes, the method teaches me in a fast way, whilst still giving
              me all information, it does sometimes come with a negative, as I
              want to experiment too much at times, sometimes wanting to make
              things better than what they have to be, which can take a lot of
              time, I now iterate until something does everything it has to
              decently, and come back only when there is time left to improve,
              something I learned from various projects. I also love to learn, I
              like to improve and explore, and will always find ways to
              challenge myself, this also comes with a disadvantage, as I have
              to force myself to make back-up plans, in case something goes
              amiss, it also causes me to want to do less relevant stuff, for
              example, for my last portfolio I learned how to code it, taking
              away time from reflecting. My passion in design is 3D modelling,
              something that is very dear to me and I love to do and hope that I
              will be able to continue doing in the future.

              I see design as a means that can help others or improve processes,
              something that keeps repeating and something that is never
              finished since the world and the people for which you design also
              always change. But one can not iterate forever, and sometimes you
              have to realize that something will not work, just like the sunk
              cost fallacy, the question is when this is the case, for me, it is
              when you stop learning, which ties to my professional identity.
              This also ties to another thing I feel is very important, I think
              that we should never stop learning, designers especially, that
              ties to my view on life and to my professional identity, since I
              like the iterative design process. One example is the mindset used
              and popularized by the Japanese, 改善 (kaizen) (improve) which is
              a mindset in which people and companies strive for continuous
              improvement, making processes easier and less taxing, mentally and
              physically. The type of products I like the most are free
              products, ones that can be used by everyone regardless of income,
              I like these products because I want everyone to be able to learn,
              to be able to improve and do what people like doing, these
              products, however, do have a problem as they too must make money
              to be able to keep running, there are multiple examples of
              business models that have free products that I like, one example
              is for the 3D modelling software I use, Blender, the company for
              this software makes money by using donations, subscriptions, and
              merchandise, but I realize that this is not possible for most
              companies another example are creators on YouTube, who have given
              a big part of a generation the chance to learn, these creators get
              paid from ad revenue, merchandise, donations and some also give
              more advanced courses.
